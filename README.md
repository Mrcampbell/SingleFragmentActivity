# SingleFragmentActivity
Implementation of a SingleFragmentActivity, with directions from Big Nerd Ranch

# To Use
I would create the Activities and Fragments manually and then bring in the contents of the files.  I didn't include the gradle, build info, or any tests to keep the project consise.  

The essentials are the Layout Files, and the Activities/Fragments.  As well as the changes to the App Manifest.  Pretty simple, really.
