    <string name="app_explanation">
        This is an example of a SingleFragmentActivity
        \nimplementation The fragmented approach allows
        \nyou to develop extensible, multi-paned
        \napplications without having to refactor.  It\'s
        \nmore work up front, but avoids the minefield of
        \nimplementing it later.
        \n\nThe steps to implement it is as follows:
        \n\n1. Create a SingleFragmentActivity that is abstract and has
              onCreate(Bundle) Method and an abstract createFragment()
              function.  It extends the AppCompatActivity.
        \n\n2. Create a host layout named activity_fragment.xml that has
              a single FrameLayout that will host the fragment.
        \n\n3. ParentActivity will implement the SingleFragmentActivity
              and override the createFragment()
        \n\n4. ChildFragment extends the Fragment class and is a fully fledged,
              final product fragment.
